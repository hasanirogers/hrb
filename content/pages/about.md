Hey everyone!

I consider myself a Full Stack web developer with a stronger emphasis on the Front End. Unlike a lot of developers, I enjoy css and design and [I do this professionally with my own business Deific Arts, LLC](https://deificarts.com). My backend experience is mostly with PHP and Wordpress. [I published my own WordPress plugin](https://ippm.hasanirogers.me). I also dabble in Node from time to time. As you can probably tell from reading my content here, I'm a huge fan of [Google Lit](https://lit.dev). I've been working with this library since it's alpha releases. In 2022 I was able to use it professionally while working a Design System for T-Mobile. Speaking of design systems, I love them too! I have my own that can be found at [https://kemet.dev](https://kemet.dev). I'm proud to say this blog has a dependency on it.

In my free time I like to read books and watch videos about ancient Egyptian culture. I'm actually listening to something about it as I write this! You'll see that my passion projects typically make references to ancient Egypt such as "Kemet". I also enjoy video games a lot. If you want to get a hold of me feel free to contact me via [my contact page](https://contact.hasanirogers.me).
